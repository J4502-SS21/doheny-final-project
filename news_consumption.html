  <h2>Variables Affecting News Consumption</h2>
  <p>There are various variables that can affect news consumption. Two main aspects include education and age. For example, in the U.S., there is an 11% difference between those who have had more or less education when it comes to following international news. 64% of people with less education are likely to follow international news, whereas 75% of people with more education are likely to follow international news. While these statistics are specifically from the U.S., this is a common trend in most countries. There is a difference in consumption of news when it comes to age as well. In the U.S., 73% of those between the ages of 18 and 29 closely follow local news, 82% of those between the ages of 30 and 49 closely follow local news and 87% of those who are 50 and older closely follow the local news. In fact, older people in general follow national and international news more closely also. This is pretty common in most global communities around the world.</p>
