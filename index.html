    <h2>What is international news coverage?</h2>
    <p>International news coverage is one option when it comes to consuming the news. By providing information regarding conflicts around the world, international news can have a huge impact. However, sometimes it's more convenient for consumers to focus on the news that only applies to themselves. According to the PEW Research Center, 68% of Americans follow international news closely (will also include the other countries I decide to include in this part).</p>

    <h3>What are the different types of news coverage?</h3>
    <p>There are a few different categories of news coverage based on geography: local, national and international. Each of these types have certain similarities and differences to one another. Since many people like to know how situations will affect themselves or their specific community, that means that consuming international news can become less of a priority.</p>

    <h4>Hows do people consume the news?</h4>
    <p>Various factors like age and a person's level of education can play a role in how people choose to consume their news. Globally, it's much more common for people to follow national and local news closer than international news. With other factors, many countries have similar ways of consuming the news.</p>

    <h5>What is the impact of international news coverage?</h5>
    <p>While many people may not realize it, international news coverage connects countries in so many ways. Through international news coverage, the #BLackLivesMatter protests in the U.S. sparked police brutality protests in so many other countries, like Canada and Nigeria. The Australian wildfires were captured through the news, which showed the rest of the world some of the real affects of climate change. The whole world has been able to connect through the same struggles of COVID-19 with the help of international news. Even some political situations have changed because of international news coverage. By consuming news throughout the world, people are able to find alternate solutions and similar situations.</p>
