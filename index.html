    <h2>What is international news coverage?</h2>
    <p>International news coverage is one option when it comes to consuming the news. By providing information regarding conflicts around the world, international news can have a huge impact. However, sometimes it's more convenient for consumers to focus on the news that only applies to themselves. According to the PEW Research Center, 68% of Americans follow international news closely (will also include the other countries I decide to include in this part).</p>

    <h3>What are the different types of news coverage?</h3>
    <p>There are a few different categories of news coverage geographically: local, national and international. Each of these types have certain similarities and differences to one another. Since many people like to know how situations will affect themselves, that means that international news tends to be overlooked.</p>

    <h4>Hows do people consume the news?</h4>
    <p>Various factors like age and a person's level of education can play a role in how people choose to consume their news. Globally, it's much more common for people to follow national and local news closer than international news. However, there are similar trends in many countries that are consistent when other factors are included.</p>

    <h5>What is the impact of international news coverage?</h5>
    <p>While many people may not realize it, international news coverage connects countries in so many ways. Through international news coverage, the #BLackLivesMatter protests in the U.S. sparked police brutality protests in so many other countries, like Canada and Nigeria. The Australian wildfires were captured through the news, which showed the rest of the world some of the real affects of climate change. The whole world has been able to connect through the same struggles of COVID-19 with the help of international news. Even some political situations change because of international news coverage. By consuming news throughout the world, people are able to find alternate solutions and similar situations.</p>
