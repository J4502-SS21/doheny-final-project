  <h2>Black Lives Matter</h2>
  <p>In May of 2020, a flood of protests was sparked in the U.S. This was due to the killing of George Floyd and racial unrest that had been going on throughout the country. The #BlackLivesMatter protests didn't stay in one country, though. Due to international news coverage, other countries were able to see this conflict. In fact, the coverage led to protests in other places like Canada, Paris, Nigeria and so many more places. In fact, the #BLM protests revived the ongoing #EndSARS protests in Nigeria, both covering police brutality. Due to international news coverage, countries around the world were able to stand up to a cause that they could all relate on.</p>

  <h3>Australian Wildfires</h3>
  <p>The beginning of 2020 was rough for Australia. They faced some of the largest wildfires with 6% of the country in flames, causing so much damage to animals and their ecosystems. With international news coverage, other people from countries around the world were able to see devastating videos of firefighters saving koalas. While this event caused damage to Australia, other countries were also able to relate to the irreparable effects of climate change. The U.S. faced their own record-breaking fires on the West Coast. Tropical storms elevated in many different countries. Through international news coverage, everyone is able to see the irreversible damage from climate change and can work together to solve this problem.</p>

  <h4>COVID-19</h4>
  <p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it did not leave anyone across the world out. It caused a global catastrophe, resulting in many deaths and the end of normal life as people knew it. However, with international news coverage, people from across the world have been able to keep up with every update regarding the pandemic. Citizens across the globe have been able to stay informed and do their part in reducing the spread, or even getting their vaccine as it becomes available to them. The news also has shown how the pandemic has affected countries differently, allowing people to help where they can while they're sitting at home. As vaccines roll out, people are also able to have the knowledge they need before getting vaccinated and knowing what is safe for themselves and those around them.</p>

  <h5>Political</h5>
  <p>Politically, many governments use international news coverage as a way to paint the picture they want. For example, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed Bin Salman did a worldwide press tour to clean up his image and show himself as the world wanted to see him. This came after the brutal killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which he was rumored to be involved in. It was recently confirmed in the past three months by CIA reports that he did hire people to kill Khashoggi. His press tour was dedicated to helping his image, which did well for him when it came to news coverage. The way a country's leader looks in the news can depend on its relations with other countries, specifically for a country like Saudi Arabia, which has huge economic ties. This is only one example, because the politics of a country can undermine their relations with other countries easily if international news organizations catch wind of certain corruptions or corrupted officials.</p>
